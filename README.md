# irssi-bidi
A bidi plugin for irssi.

Correctly display messages containing RTL text, such as in Hebrew, Arabic and etc.

## Usage
Install "fribidi" and make sure you have the fribidi executable in path.
Follow the instructions at http://scripts.irssi.org/ for how to install the plugin and enable it.

## Notes
I first wrote it and started using it in mid 2012, so it has been tested and used for years without any issues. It works great for other people's text, but unfortunately I never got around to fix presentation on input too. I rarely write in BiDi languages but read quite often.

## TODO
  * Make it work for the input line as well.
  * Fix long line wrapping handling.
  * Use libfribidi instead of the fribidi executable.

Please don't hestitae to contact me for any questions/patches.
